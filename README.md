**Multi-Vendor Vulnerability Analyzer** is a desktop application for analyzing vulnerability scan results from multiple vendors (Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7) with CVSS-based severity, SLA/aging calculations, and advanced metrics. It provides both single-scan analysis and scan comparison in a native GUI — no browser required.

Designed for vulnerability management and SOC workflows, this tool provides SLA tracking, exploit visibility, risk scoring, and visual analytics — all in a native executable with no Python or browser required.

## Features

- **Multi-Vendor Support:** Automatically detects scan source (Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7) with override option.
- **CVSS-Based Severity:** Standardized FedRAMP-aligned severity mapping:
  - Critical: 9.0–10.0
  - High: 7.0–8.9
  - Medium: 4.0–6.9
  - Low: 0.1–3.9
- **Compliance Profiles:** SLA/aging rules based on severity (FedRAMP Moderate/High or Custom).
- **Single Scan Analysis:**
  - Metrics summary: Critical, High, Medium, Low counts
  - Expired vulnerabilities based on SLA
  - CVSS ≥9 count and oldest vulnerability
  - Risk Score calculation
  - Enriched table including Plugin ID, Name, Host, CVSS, Age, Days Left, Expired status, and Solution
- **Scan Comparison (New vs Old):**
  - Highlights new, resolved, and unchanged vulnerabilities
  - Comparison table with status per entry
  - Downloadable CSV of comparison results
- **Visualizations (Plotly):**
  - Severity Pie Chart
  - Top 5 Hosts by Critical Vulnerabilities
  - Aging Buckets Pie Chart (0–30, 31–60, 61–90, 90+ days)
- **Cleaned CSV Export:** Save enriched report for further analysis.
- **Native Desktop GUI:** Fully interactive with tables, dropdowns, and buttons; no browser required.
